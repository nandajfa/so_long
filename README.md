   ## 🗣️ About

> _This project is a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements._

#### 

The goals of this project are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous,
level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so
forth. <br/>
So long is a graphic design project. It will help you improve your skills in the following
areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
