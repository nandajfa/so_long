   ## 🗣️ About

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you
will be able to reuse it in future projects without the fear of being flagged as a cheater.
You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments._

#### 

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for
us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions
in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.
